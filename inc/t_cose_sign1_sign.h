/**
 * \file t_cose_sign1_sign.h
 *
 * \brief Create a \c COSE_Sign1, usually for EAT or CWT Token.
 *
 * This creates a \c COSE_Sign1 in compliance with [COSE (RFC 8152)]
 * (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8152). A \c COSE_Sign1 is a CBOR
 * encoded binary blob that contains headers, a payload and a
 * signature. Usually the signature is made with an EC signing
 * algorithm like ECDSA.
 *
 * This implementation is intended to be small and portable to
 * different OS's and platforms. Its dependencies are:
 * - QCBOR
 * - <stdint.h>, <string.h>, <stddef.h>
 * - Hash functions like SHA-256
 * - Signing functions like ECDSA
 *
 * There is a cryptographic adaptation layer defined in
 * t_cose_crypto.h.  An implementation can be made of the functions in
 * it for different cryptographic libraries. This means that different
 * integrations with different cryptographic libraries may support only
 * signing with a particular set
 * of algorithms. Key ID look up also varies by different cryptographic
 * library integrations.
 *
 * This \c COSE_Sign1 implementations is optimized for creating EAT
 * and CWT tokens.
 *
 * It should work for CWT and others use cases too. The main point of
 * the optimization is that only one output buffer is needed. There is
 * no need for one buffer to hold the payload and another to hold the
 * end result \c COSE_Sign1. The payload is encoded right into its final
 * place in the end result \c COSE_Sign1.

/**
 * This is the context for creating a \c COSE_Sign1 structure. The caller
 * should allocate it and pass it to the functions here.  This is
 * about 100 bytes so it fits easily on the stack.

 * public key cryptographic functions have not been connected up in
 * the cryptographic adaptation layer.
 *
 * It has no value for security at all. Data signed this way MUST
 * NOT be trusted as anyone can sign like this.
 *
 * In this mode, the signature is the hash of that which would normally be
 * signed by the public key algorithm. To make the signature the
 * correct size for the particular algorithm, instances of the hash are
 * concatenated to pad it out.
 *
 * This mode is very useful for testing because all the code except
 * the actual signing algorithm is run exactly as it would if a proper
 * signing algorithm was run. This can be used for end-end system testing all
 * the way to a server or relying party, not just for testing device code.

 * \param[in] out_buf  Pointer and length of buffer to output to.
 * \param[out] result  Pointer and length of the resulting \c COSE_Sign1.
 *
 * The \c context must have been initialized with t_cose_sign1_init()
 * and the key set with t_cose_sign1_set_key() before this is called.
 *
 * This creates the COSE headers, hashes and signs the payload
 * and creates the signature. \c out_buf gives the pointer and
 * length memory into which the output is written. The pointer
 * and length of the actual \c COSE_Sign1 is returned in \c result.
 *
 * Typically the required size of \c out_buf is about 30 bytes plus the size of the
 * signature and the size of the key ID. This is about 150 bytes
 * for ECDSA 256 with a 32-byte key ID.
 *
 * To compute the size of the buffer needed before it is allocated
 * call this with \c out_buf containg a \c NULL pointer and large length like \c UINT32_MAX.
 * The algorithm and key, kid and such should be set up just as if
 * the real \c COSE_Sign1 were to be created as these values are needed
 * to compute the size correctly.
 * The contents of \c result will be a \c NULL pointer and the length
 * of the \c COSE_Sign1. When this is run
 * like this, the cryptographic functions will not actually run, but
 * the size of their output will be taken into account.
 *
 * This function requires the payload be completed formatted
 * in a contiguous buffer. The resulting \C COSE_Sign1 also
 * contains the payload preceeded by the headers and followed
 * by the signature, all CBOR formatted. This function
 * thus requires two copies of the payload to be in memory.
 * Alternatively t_cose_sign1_output_headers() and t_cose_sign1_output_signature()
 * can be used. They are more complex to use, but  avoid
