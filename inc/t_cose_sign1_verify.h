 *
 * \brief Verify a COSE_Sign1
 *
 * This verifies a \c COSE_Sign1 in compliance with [COSE (RFC 8152)]
 * (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8152). A \c COSE_Sign1 is a CBOR
 * encoded binary blob that contains headers, a payload and a
 * signature. Usually the signature is made with an EC signing
 * algorithm like ECDSA.
 *
 * This implementation is intended to be small and portable to
 * different OS's and platforms. Its dependencies are:
 * - QCBOR
 * - <stdint.h>, <string.h>, <stddef.h>
 * - Hash functions like SHA-256
 * - Signature verifications functions like ECDSA
 *
 * There is a cryptographic adaptation layer defined in
 * t_cose_crypto.h.  An implementation can be made of the functions in
 * it for different platforms or OS's. This means that different
 * platforms and OS's may support only verification with a particular set
 * of algorithms.

 *
 * \param[in] sign1             Pointer and length of CBOR encoded \c COSE_Sign1
 *                              that is to be verified.
 * \param[out] payload          Pointer and length of the payload.
 * \param[out] headers          Place to return parsed headers. Maybe be NULL.
 *
 * \return This returns one of the error codes defined by \ref t_cose_err_t.
 *
 * The source of the verification key depends on the how the how the
 * underlying cryptographic layer works. Simpler layers have no key
 * store or database in which case the verification key must be passed in
 * the \c verification_key parameter.
 * The OpenSSL cryptographic layer works like this.
 *
 * Usually the kid (key ID) header parameter identifies the verification
 * key needed to verify the signature. With a simple cryptographic adaption
 * layer, the caller wishing to use the key ID should call this function
 * twice, the first time with the \ref T_COSE_OPT_PARSE_ONLY option set
 * and with \c header non-NULL. The kid will be returned in \c headers.
 * The caller must then find the key on their own, then call this
 * again without the \ref T_COSE_OPT_PARSE_ONLY option.
 *
 * When the cryptographic adaptation layer supports key lookup,
 * then calling this twice is not necessary. Also, if the key is
 * somehow know without examining the \c COSE_Sign1, calling this
 * twice is not necessary.
 *
 * Verification involves the following steps.
 *
 * The CBOR-format COSE_Sign1 structure is parsed. It makes sure \c sign1
 * is valid CBOR and follows the required structure for \c COSE_Sign1.
 *
 * The protected headers are parsed, particular the algorithm id.
 *
 * The unprotected headers are parsed, particularly the kid.
 *
 * The payload is identified. The internals of the payboad are not parsed.
 *
 * The expected hash, the "to-be-signed" bytes are computed. The hash
 * algorithm to use comes from the signing algorithm in the protected
 * headers. If the algorithm is not known or not supported this will
 * error out.
 *
 * Finally, the signature verification is performed.
 *
 * If it is successful, the pointer of the CBOR-encoded payload is
 * returned. The headers are returned if requested.
 *
 * Note that this only handles standard COSE headers. There are no
 * facilities for custom headers, even though they are allowed.
 *
 * This will recognize the special key ID for short-circuit signing
 * and verify it if the \ref T_COSE_OPT_ALLOW_SHORT_CIRCUIT is set.
 *
 * Indefinite lengths strings are not supported. \ref T_COSE_ERR_SIGN1_FORMAT
 * will be returned if they are in the input \c COSE_Sign1 messages. For
 * example, if the payload is an indefinite length byte string.
